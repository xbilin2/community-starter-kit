# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Community Starter Kit

Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through to learn about making your project friendlier for collaboration.

The project will identify your location with permission.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!
